# This is a Bookstore web app written in Typescript and Java

## Technologies used:

### Frontend

- Next.js
- Tailwind
- ShadcnUI
- Lucide Icons

### Backend (thanks to @adrianpush)

- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- Subapase
- OpenAI (book recommendations based on orders)

To run project:
- Clone
- Install deps via `pnpm i` or `npm i` (pnpm recommended)
- Start dev server via `pnpm dev` or `npm dev`
- Follow other scripts in `package.json` to build and others.
* Note: Because of its strongly dependent on backend API it will look like crashing due to fetch error but dont worry its intentional as a security step. For further info refer to me via opening an issue or reaching directly.
